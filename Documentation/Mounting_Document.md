## Introduction

The LipSync is a mouth operated sip and puff joystick that enables people to use mobile devices such as a mobile phone, and other

The lightness of the LipSync as well as its compactness make it a great candidate for portable, wheelchair mounted applications but some considerations need to be taken when choosing a mounting option to ensure ease of use and safety of the user. This document details the considerations of how to mount the LipSync. Now that you have the LipSync, how can you mount it onto a wheelchair? What options are there for your mobile device? What are some of the considerations to have in mind when choosing a mounting option?

## Mounting Requirements

## Considerations

When choosing a mount, many things need to be taken into consideration to ensure the safety of the user. Below you&#39;ll find a complete detailed list of these considerations. For a quick checklist, refer to Appendix A Checklist for After Choosing a Mount.

1. Mounting at the sides can make doorways difficult to navigate. Modern wheelchairs are 24&quot;-27&quot; in width and a wheelchair accessible door is usually 32&quot; therefore care should be taken when mounting to the side of the wheelchair. Ensure that the addition of the mount at the sides of the wheelchair **does not** extend beyond the wheelchair frame to avoid hitting the doorway and potentially dislodging the mount, thereby putting the user at a safety risk. There is also a risk of the mount getting caught in obstacles. The image below demonstrates a setup that must be avoided as it can be easily snagged on something or could potentially bump into surrounding objects.

**Figure 2 - Image of an Unacceptable Mount Setup**

1. Attaching a clamp vertically may cause slipping of the mount. Therefore care must be taken when mounting in this direction.
2. To increase the friction and avoid slipping of a clamp additional anti skid pads may be added. A common product that is used for this purpose is Dycem, which provides reels of non-slip mats and tapes. Another option is &quot;Magic Wrap&quot; used for plumbing repairs.
3. Care should be taken when mounting to the headrest especially in reclining chairs. In a reclined position, the mount is more likely to detach and fall. Some solutions to this problem is increasing the friction of the mount using methods described above. Another solution is to choose a mount that completely encases the rail of the headrest as shown in the image below.

![](RackMultipart20200730-4-7koq9h_html_5cc9ed4b2e87dd20.jpg)

**Figure** 3 **- A bottom and isometric view of a clamp that does not encase the rail vs. one that does**

1. Wiring must be avoided to prevent faulty connections of the wheelchair devices.
2. Clearance around the wheels must be maintained to avoid detachment of the device or damage to the wheelchair.
3. In many wheelchairs, reclining causes a few components of the wheelchair to shift in position. Therefore, when choosing a mounting point check that there is clearance around the different components in both a reclined and non-reclined position.
4. When positioning the LipSync, care should be taken to ensure that the driving view of the user is not obstructed.
5. When positioning the LipSync, make sure that it is vertically aligned as described in Figure 4. Assemblies with goosenecks or ball and sockets at the top allow for positioning the LipSync vertically.

![](RackMultipart20200730-4-7koq9h_html_3e669ee4ebb9f11a.png)

**Figure 4 - Left: LipSync Positioned Vertically; Right: LipSync Positioned Non-vertically**

1. When positioning the mobile device ensure that it is within viewing angle of the LipSync. The normal optical axis for a person in a sitting position is at 15? below eye level (Figure 4).

For example, if mounting a phone 35cm away from your face, the normal optical axis for a person in a sitting position is 15? below the 0? line, which translates to 7cm below eye level at that distance (Appendix D Field of Vision Claculations). The Limit of the range of vision is at 70-80?.

**Figure 5 - Field of Vision Range [CITATION Acc \l 4105]**

1. When positioning the mobile device, make sure that it is adjusted to avoid glare from the sun. In some cases, it may be necessary to add an anti-glare screen protector to the mobile device available [here](https://www.amazon.ca/Tech-Armor-Anti-Glare-Anti-Fingerprint-Protectors/dp/B00IGISQUO).
2. On some power wheelchairs, the armrest can be lifted to allow for transferring the wheelchair user. Therefore, mounting to that side of the wheelchair in those cases is not recommended.
3. Mounting at the back of the wheelchair requires the mount to be very long compared to other mounting points. In this position the mount experiences a large amount of torque which could cause it to fail.

## Mounting to a Wheelchair

## Mounting Points

Every wheelchair is different in terms of the points available for mounting. Below is a list of some common mounting points that are available on power wheelchairs. The sketches illustrate the locations of these mounting points on the wheelchair.

      1. Headrest rail
1. Back of wheelchair
2. Armrest rail
3. Under chair cushion
4. Chair rail
5. Footplate

## Mounting Assemblies

Below you&#39;ll find some wheelchair mounting options for the LipSync, a mobile device, or the combination of both. Endless setups may be assembled to fit a user&#39;s needs. Some setups may be more convenient than others depending on the considerations listed in the previous sections. Some of these components can be purchased from other suppliers.

## LipSync

The LipSync can be mounted in several different ways:

The LipSync housing has a 1

The LipSync has a standard 5/8&quot;-27 thread female connection. The mounting options below include a 5/8&quot;-27 thread male connection in order to connect to the LipSync.

### Mounting Options Per Price Range

#### $0 - $49

Most of the options below include a 3D printed clamp which contributes to the reduced price. The downside of using 3D printed parts is the reduction in the strength of the component and the likelihood of it breaking if used to hold up a heavy weight.

For the assembly instructions of the 3D Printed Clamp refer to Appendix B Assembly Instructions for 3D Printed Clamp.

For assembly instruction of the DIY Mount refer to Appendix C Assembly Instructions for DIY Mount.

_Note:_ _There are two possible assemblies for the DIY Mount._ _A Mini Ball Head with Lock may be used in cases where the articulating arm and the arrow shafts do not provide enough flexibility to position the LipSync vertically. Steps for both options are included below._

## Mobile Device

### No Mount

In some cases, the mobile device may be placed on the user&#39;s lap, the lap tray mounted on their wheelchair, or on a table in front of the user. In this case there is no need for a mount. A stand may be used to adjust the viewing angle of the phone.

### Mount

Most phone mounts have a standard 1/4&quot;-20 female thread. Therefore, many mobile device holders may be selected in combination with the LipSync mounting options listed in the previous section (LipSync). The changes that need to be made relate to adding an adapter with a 1/4&quot;-20 male thread. One potential option for a phone mount assembly is listed in the table below.

### Combining LipSync and Mobile Device

There are some options to combine both the LipSync and a mobile device into one mount assembly setup. The idea of combining the LipSync and a mobile device simplifies the mount assembly process since it requires choosing only one mounting point. Combining the two systems also allows for a reduction in price since only one clamp is used. Two possible combinations were assessed and will be detailed below.

The first option includes the Loc Line hoses. Since a Y fitting is available, a system using these hoses can be formed to attach both a mobile device and the LipSync. The table below provides a complete assembly.

## Suggestions for Assembling Mounts

1. Tape some anti-skid pads like Dycem pads or &quot;Magic Wrap&quot; to increase the friction of the clamps and reduce their rotation about the tube.
2. If two assembly pieces are used, such as two goosenecks, glue them together at the attachment point to avoid separation or rotation.
3. Some of the problems associated with Loc-Line and goosenecks is the instability and their tendency to sag after continuous use. This could be solved using rescue tape, electrical tape or &quot;Magic Wrap&quot; wrapped around the pieces. Another solution is to add a stiff wire to the inside of the parts.
4. Goosenecks are a good option for small sections, but may become unstable as the length increases and may sag under their own weight. Therefore, it is not advisable to use goosenecks when the mounting point is further away from the user, such as the back of the wheelchair.
5. When using Loc Line, use the 3/4&quot; tubes as the base to provide stability and stiffness to the setup. 1/2&quot; tubes may be used at the top of the assembly.

1. _Mini Ball Head with Lock and Hot Shoe Adapter Camera (optional)_
2. _1/4 male to 3/8 male adapter (optional)_
3. _3/8 female to 5/8 male adapter (optiona)_

Steps:

1. Assemble the 3D printed clamp as described in Appendix B Assembly Instructions for 3D Printed Clamp.
2. Screw the 11&quot; Inch Friction Articulating Magic Arm for Camera DSLR into the Mic Adapter in the 3D printed clamp.
3. Determine the length of the arrow shaft necessary by adjusting the articulating arm and approximating the length necessary to reach the mouth of the user. There will be two sections of arrow shafts in total.
4. Use the tube cutter to cut the arrow shaft to size. Make sure to file the ends of the arrow shaft to remove sharp edges.

Note: we found that increasing the length of the arrow shaft increases the vibration of the whole assembly, which makes it difficult to use the LipSync. The maximum suggested length arrow shaft to use is 9&quot;.

1. Glue the 3D printed 3/8-16 threaded holder on one end of an arrow shaft.
2. Screw in the 5/8 to 3/8 threaded adapter in the LipSync. Make sure to leave room for the LipSync spacer or to place the spacer in its position.
3. Screw the 3/8-16 threaded holder into LipSync to help with aligning the Disk Gear. Be careful not to over-tighten as to avoid breaking the threaded holder.
4. Place the Disk Gear at the other end of the arrow shaft. Make sure that the side of the disk is aligned with the LipSync as shown in the image below. Glue the arrow shaft in the Disk Gear.
